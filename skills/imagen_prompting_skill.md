## Prompting Philosophy: Natural Language First

### The Paradigm Shift

Imagen 4 represents a fundamental shift from traditional prompt engineering:

**OLD APPROACH (Keyword-Based)**:
```
portrait, woman, 85mm, bokeh, golden hour, detailed, masterpiece, 4k
```

**IMAGEN 4 APPROACH (Natural Language)**:
```
A close-up portrait of a woman in her thirties, photographed during golden hour. The soft, warm light creates a gentle glow on her skin, with the background melting into a beautiful bokeh blur. Shot on an 85mm lens with shallow depth of field.
```

### Core Principle: Describe, Don't List

Write prompts as if describing a scene to a professional photographer or cinematographer. Use complete sentences, natural grammar, and narrative structure.

---

## Prompt Structure & Syntax

### Basic Structure
```
[Subject] + [Context/Action] + [Style/Medium] + [Modifiers]
```

### Advanced Structure (Narrative Approach)
```
[Setting/Atmosphere] + [Main Subject with detailed description] + [Spatial Relationships] + [Lighting & Mood] + [Technical Camera Details]
```

### The Narrative Framework

Imagen 4 excels when prompts follow a natural narrative flow:

1. **Set the Scene**: Establish the environment and atmosphere
2. **Introduce the Subject**: Describe the main focus with rich detail
3. **Define Relationships**: Explain how elements relate spatially
4. **Describe Lighting**: Explain light source, quality, and effect
5. **Add Technical Context**: Camera, lens, and photographic details (when relevant)

## Prompting Techniques by Category

### 1. Photorealism & Texture

**Goal**: Achieve photography-indistinguishable results

**Key Strategies**:
- **Light Context Over Keywords**: Instead of "good lighting," describe: "Soft morning light filters through sheer curtains, creating a diffused glow"
- **Micro-Detail Specification**: "Visible skin pores," "Individual hair strands catching light," "Fine fabric weave texture"
- **Material Properties**: Describe how materials interact with light—"Matte ceramic surface," "Polished chrome reflecting surroundings," "Translucent silk with subsurface scattering"

**Examples**:
- ✅ "The weathered leather of the old armchair shows years of use, with fine cracks and worn patches where the arms meet the seat. Afternoon sunlight highlights the texture and rich brown patina."
- ❌ "Leather chair, detailed, realistic, 4k"

---

### 2. Precise Text Rendering

**Critical Feature**: Imagen 4 leads the industry in text rendering

**Syntax Rules**:
- **Use Quotation Marks**: Place specific text in quotes for maximum reliability: `"OPEN 24/7"`
- **Describe Font Style**: "Bold sans-serif," "Elegant script," "Retro 1980s neon typography"
- **Contextual Placement**: Describe where and how text appears: "A weathered wooden sign that reads 'Welcome Home' in hand-painted letters"

**Examples**:
- ✅ "A minimalist book cover with the title 'SILENCE' in a clean, modern sans-serif font centered on textured grey paper"
- ✅ "A vintage neon sign glowing with the words 'Midnight Diner' in retro 1950s script, casting pink and blue reflections on the wet pavement below"
- ✅ "The text 'SALE' written in condensation on a cold window pane, with droplets beginning to run down"

**Multi-Language Support**: Imagen 4 handles text in multiple languages—specify language when relevant: "Chinese characters reading '拉麺' in red neon"

---

### 3. Spatial Reasoning & Complex Positioning

**Strength**: Imagen 4's spatial understanding surpasses most competitors

**Positioning Keywords**:
- **Relative Position**: "to the left of," "behind," "in front of," "next to," "between"
- **Depth**: "in the foreground," "in the background," "in the distance"
- **Containment**: "inside," "nested within," "emerging from"
- **Elevation**: "hovering above," "resting on top of," "suspended from"
- **Partial Occlusion**: "partially hidden by," "peeking out from behind"

**Layering Strategy**: Explicitly describe foreground, midground, and background

**Examples**:
- ✅ "A minimalist living room where a sleek black cat is sleeping on a white rug, positioned to the left of a tall fiddle-leaf fig plant. In the background, a large window reveals a rainy city skyline at dusk."
- ✅ "A small blue cube sitting precisely behind a large red sphere on a polished mahogany table. The sphere partially obscures the cube from view, with only the top edges visible."
- ✅ "A glass of water resting on a wooden table in the foreground. In the midground, an open book with reading glasses placed on top. In the background, a blurred window showing a garden."

---

### 4. Lighting & Atmosphere

**Approach**: Describe lighting as a photographer would

**Lighting Components**:
1. **Source**: "Natural window light," "Studio softbox," "Candlelight," "Overhead fluorescent"
2. **Quality**: "Soft and diffused," "Hard and directional," "Volumetric with visible rays"
3. **Direction**: "Side lighting," "Backlighting," "Top-down," "Rim lighting"
4. **Time/Color**: "Golden hour warmth," "Blue hour coolness," "Midday harsh light," "Twilight ambiance"

**Advanced Lighting Terms**:
- `Volumetric lighting` — Visible light beams through atmosphere
- `Subsurface scattering` — Light penetrating translucent materials
- `Rim lighting` — Edge highlighting from backlight
- `Three-point lighting` — Key, fill, and rim light setup
- `High-key` — Bright, minimal shadows
- `Low-key` — Dark, dramatic shadows

**Examples**:
- ✅ "The soft morning light filters through a dusty window of an old library, illuminating floating dust motes in the air and casting long, gentle shadows across the wooden floor"
- ✅ "Dramatic rim lighting from the setting sun creates a golden outline around the subject's silhouette, while the face remains in soft shadow"
- ✅ "Studio photography with three-point lighting: a main softbox from the left, fill light from the right to soften shadows, and a rim light from behind to separate the subject from the background"

---

### 5. Camera & Technical Photography

**When to Include**: Photorealistic scenes, portraits, product photography

**Lens Specifications**:
- `50mm prime` — Natural perspective, versatile
- `85mm` — Portrait lens, flattering compression
- `24mm wide-angle` — Environmental context, spatial depth
- `200mm telephoto` — Compressed perspective, subject isolation
- `Macro lens` — Extreme close-ups, fine detail

**Aperture & Depth of Field**:
- `f/1.2`, `f/1.4`, `f/1.8` — Very shallow depth of field, strong bokeh
- `f/2.8`, `f/4` — Moderate depth, selective focus
- `f/8`, `f/11`, `f/16` — Deep focus, everything sharp

**Shot Types**:
- `Close-up` / `Extreme close-up` — Intimate detail
- `Medium shot` — Subject from waist up
- `Wide shot` / `Establishing shot` — Full scene context
- `Over-the-shoulder` — Perspective shot
- `Bird's eye view` / `Aerial perspective` — Top-down

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Shot on a 50mm lens at f/1.2, creating an extremely shallow depth of field where only the subject's eyes are in sharp focus while the background melts into a creamy bokeh"
- ✅ "Captured with a macro lens at 1:1 magnification, revealing the intricate details of the butterfly's wing scales and the fine hairs on its body"
- ✅ "Wide-angle 24mm shot from a low angle, emphasizing the towering architecture and creating dramatic perspective distortion"

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

1. **Use Natural Language**: Write in complete, grammatically correct sentences
2. **Describe Narratively**: Build the scene with atmospheric and contextual detail
3. **Specify Lighting Context**: Describe source, quality, direction, and color temperature
4. **Use Quotes for Text**: Always enclose specific text in quotation marks
5. **Layer Spatial Information**: Explicitly describe foreground, midground, background
6. **Include Material Details**: Describe textures and how they interact with light
7. **Describe Mood**: Emotional and atmospheric context enhances results
8. **Leverage Gemini Integration**: Use Gemini to expand simple ideas into rich prompts
9. **Trust the Model**: Imagen 4's intelligence means you don't need "quality keywords" like "masterpiece, 4k, detailed"

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Use Keyword Soup**: Avoid comma-separated lists without structure: "woman, portrait, 85mm, bokeh, golden hour, detailed, masterpiece"
2. **Over-Specify Quality**: Terms like "masterpiece," "4k," "ultra-detailed" are unnecessary—Imagen 4 defaults to high quality
3. **Be Vague**: "Good lighting" or "nice composition" provide no useful guidance
4. **Forget Text Quotes**: Unquoted text may not render reliably
5. **Ignore Spatial Relationships**: Vague positioning leads to ambiguous results
6. **Neglect Lighting Description**: Lighting is crucial for photorealism
7. **Mix Conflicting Styles**: Be coherent in your aesthetic direction
8. **Assume Old Prompting Rules**: Imagen 4 works differently than older models—embrace natural language

## Example Prompts

### Example 1: Photorealistic Portrait with Narrative Depth

```
A close-up portrait of a weathered hand holding a delicate glass butterfly. The afternoon sunlight streams through a nearby window, catching the iridescent wings and casting colorful rainbow reflections onto the wrinkled, aged skin. The background is softly blurred, showing hints of a cluttered artist's workshop. Shot on a macro lens with shallow depth of field, focusing precisely on the intricate wing details while the background melts into a warm, creamy bokeh.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Natural language narrative structure
- Rich sensory and visual details (weathered hand, iridescent wings, rainbow reflections)
- Clear lighting description (afternoon sunlight, window source)
- Spatial context (workshop background)
- Technical camera details (macro lens, shallow DOF)
- Emotional subtext (aged hands holding delicate beauty)

---

### Example 2: Complex Spatial Scene

```
A minimalist Scandinavian living room bathed in soft morning light. In the foreground, a sleek black cat is curled up sleeping on a white shag rug. To the left of the cat, a tall fiddle-leaf fig plant in a simple terracotta pot reaches toward the ceiling. In the background, a large floor-to-ceiling window reveals a rainy city skyline at dawn, with droplets streaming down the glass. The overall atmosphere is calm and contemplative, with a muted color palette of whites, grays, and soft greens.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Clear spatial hierarchy (foreground: cat, left: plant, background: window)
- Specific positional relationships ("to the left of," "in the background")
- Atmospheric lighting (soft morning light)
- Material and texture details (white shag rug, terracotta pot, glass with droplets)
- Mood definition (calm, contemplative)
- Cohesive aesthetic (Scandinavian minimalism, muted palette)

---

### Example 3: Typography & Design Integration

```
A minimalist book cover design with the title 'SILENCE' in a clean, modern sans-serif font, centered on the upper third of the composition. The background is a textured grey paper with subtle fiber details visible in the light. In the center of the cover, a single dried lavender flower is pressed flat, its delicate purple petals contrasting against the grey. The overall design is elegant and understated, with plenty of negative space creating a sense of calm and quietude.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Text in quotes with font style specified
- Material details (textured grey paper, fiber details)
- Clear compositional structure (centered, upper third)
- Visual hierarchy and balance
- Thematic coherence (silence → minimalism, negative space, calm)
- Sensory details (dried flower, delicate petals)

---

### Example 4: Product Photography with Technical Precision

```
A high-end product photograph of a luxury Swiss watch resting on a polished black marble surface. The watch features a deep midnight blue dial with rose gold accents, and its sapphire crystal face reflects subtle highlights from the carefully positioned studio lighting. Tiny water droplets are scattered across the marble surface, each one catching and refracting light like miniature prisms. The background fades to a soft, graduated charcoal grey. Shot with three-point lighting: a key softbox creating gentle highlights on the watch face, a fill light softening shadows, and a rim light separating the watch from the background. Captured on a macro lens with extreme shallow depth of field at f/2.8, with the focus precisely on the watch's intricate dial details while the background dissolves into smooth bokeh.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Product-focused with commercial intent
- Precise material specifications (sapphire crystal, rose gold, marble)
- Detailed lighting setup (three-point with specific roles)
- Micro-details (water droplets as prisms)
- Technical camera specifications appropriate for product work
- Depth control for visual impact (sharp focus → smooth bokeh)

---

### Example 5: Architectural Photography

```
A stunning modern architectural photograph of a minimalist glass and concrete villa nestled in a lush tropical jungle. The structure features floor-to-ceiling glass walls that perfectly mirror the surrounding vibrant greenery, creating a seamless visual dialogue between the built environment and nature. In the foreground, a serene infinity pool stretches toward the edge of the frame, its still surface reflecting both the sky above and the dense jungle canopy. The scene is captured during the golden hour, with warm, diffused sunlight filtering through the jungle foliage and casting dappled patterns on the villa's polished concrete surfaces. Shot with a wide-angle 24mm lens to emphasize the scale and integration with the landscape, using a high dynamic range approach to capture detail in both the bright exterior and the interior spaces visible through the glass.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Architectural focus with design philosophy (minimalist, nature integration)
- Material specifications (glass, concrete, polished surfaces)
- Spatial layering (foreground: pool, midground: villa, background: jungle)
- Detailed lighting (golden hour, diffused, dappled patterns)
- Technical photography approach (wide-angle, HDR)
- Thematic coherence (seamless dialogue between architecture and nature)

---

### Example 6: Atmospheric Narrative Scene

```
An atmospheric scene inside an old Parisian bookshop on a rainy afternoon. Soft, diffused light filters through rain-streaked windows, illuminating countless books stacked on floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves. In the foreground, an antique reading desk holds an open leather-bound book with yellowed pages, with a pair of vintage reading glasses resting on top. To the right of the desk, a steaming cup of coffee sits on a small saucer, wisps of steam rising into the dusty air where they catch the window light. In the background, barely visible through the atmospheric haze, more shelves recede into shadow. The color palette is warm and nostalgic—rich browns, amber light, and the soft grey of the rainy day outside. The overall mood is intimate, contemplative, and timeless.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Strong atmospheric establishment (old bookshop, rainy afternoon)
- Layered spatial description (foreground: desk and book, right: coffee, background: shelves)
- Detailed lighting with atmospheric effects (diffused light, steam catching light, dust)
- Material and texture richness (leather-bound, yellowed pages, wooden shelves)
- Sensory details (steaming coffee, rain-streaked windows)
- Color palette specification (warm browns, amber, soft grey)
- Clear mood definition (intimate, contemplative, timeless)

---

### Example 7: Complex Spatial Reasoning Challenge

```
A still life composition on a rustic wooden table. In the center, a large transparent glass sphere sits on a small wooden pedestal. Directly behind the sphere, a small blue cube is positioned so that it appears magnified and distorted when viewed through the glass. To the left of the sphere, a tall white candle burns steadily, its flame reflected in the curved glass surface. To the right, a red apple rests on the table, with the sphere creating a secondary, inverted reflection of the apple visible on the glass's surface. Soft window light comes from the left side, creating gentle shadows that stretch to the right across the table. The lighting highlights the transparency of the sphere, the texture of the wooden table, and the waxy surface of the apple.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Complex spatial relationships (behind, left, right, through, reflected)
- Physical interactions (magnification through glass, reflections, shadows)
- Clear positioning with relative references
- Lighting description with directional information
- Material properties affecting light (transparent glass, waxy apple, wooden texture)
- Tests Imagen 4's advanced spatial reasoning capabilities
